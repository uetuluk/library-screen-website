# Library Screen Website

The website is designed to display content in full screen on the Library monitor.

## Description

The purpose of this site is to facilitate a full-screen display of varying web content via iFrames for modern desktop browsers. This site will adhere to the NYU style, predominantly using the color #57068C. Additionally, the "NYU Shanghai Libraries" name should be prominently displayed.

## Tasks

* **Platform Compatibility**:
    - The website must be compatible with modern desktop browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. Mobile compatibility is not required.

* **Full-Screen Behavior**:
    - If the browser does not support auto full-screen, a clear and accessible button should be provided to users to manually trigger full-screen mode.

* **iFrame Content**:
    - The site will display content from other websites using iFrames.
    - If an iFrame fails to load a particular source, it should automatically transition to the next available source.
    
* **Swap Time**:
    - Content should be displayed for 1 minute by default.
    - Users should be able to adjust this duration via the settings, up to 60 minutes.
    - Content transitions should be smooth and visually appealing.
    
* **Loop Behavior**:
    - Users can add more content sources through the settings button.
    - If there's only one link provided, the content will remain static and wonâ€™t loop.
    
* **Settings Button and Features**:
    - The settings button should be discreetly placed at the top-right corner and should become visible when hovered over.
    - Settings can be accessed by anyone without authentication.
    - In the settings, users should have the ability to add or remove content links. There's no limit to the number of links.
    - The swap time can be adjusted in the settings, with a maximum limit of 60 minutes.

* **Design and Branding**:
    - The website design should closely align with the NYU branding style. The primary color should be #57068C.
    - The name "NYU Shanghai Libraries" should be prominently displayed on the website.

* **Hosting**:
    - This website is static and does not require any backend or dynamic capabilities.
